Imagine you're a chef in a kitchen, and you have different tasks to complete to make a delicious dish. Now, think of these tasks as actions or processes needed to create your meal. These could include chopping vegetables, boiling water, and grilling meat.

In the traditional way of cooking, you might do one thing at a time. For example, you chop the vegetables, then move on to boiling water, and finally, you grill the meat. This is similar to how a computer would execute tasks sequentially.

Now, let's introduce the concept of threads:

Single Thread (Traditional Cooking):

You are the chef working alone in the kitchen.
You start chopping vegetables, finish that, then move on to boiling water, and so on.
One task is completed before you start the next.
Multiple Threads (Parallel Cooking):

Imagine you have some kitchen helpers (threads).
Each helper can focus on a specific task independently.
One helper chops vegetables, another boils water, and a third one grills the meat.
While one task is underway, another can start simultaneously.
Analogy Explained:

In the single-threaded approach, tasks are completed one after the other, similar to how a computer executes instructions sequentially.
In the multi-threaded approach, tasks are divided among different helpers (threads), allowing them to work in parallel. This is like multiple processes happening simultaneously in a computer.

Imagine you have a shared cutting board in the kitchen, and multiple chefs (threads) need to chop vegetables on it. Now, consider the cutting board as a critical resource that only one chef can use at a time to avoid chaos.

No Mutex (Without Coordination):

Chefs (threads) can rush to the cutting board simultaneously without any coordination.
This might lead to conflicts, like two chefs trying to use the cutting board at the same time.
Mutex (With Coordination):

To prevent conflicts, you introduce a "mutex" (short for mutual exclusion), which acts like a sign saying, "Only one chef at a time."
Before a chef starts using the cutting board, they must first check if the mutex sign is available.
If the sign is available (mutex is unlocked), the chef can lock the mutex, indicating that they are using the cutting board.
After finishing chopping, the chef unlocks the mutex, allowing others to use the cutting board.

Now, imagine a scenario where multiple chefs need to work together to create a multi-course meal.
Each chef prepares their dish, but before they can serve the entire meal, they must wait for every chef to finish their part.

Without pthread_join: Chefs start cooking independently, and there's no coordination. Each chef finishes their dish without knowing if others have completed theirs.
With pthread_join: Before serving the full meal, each chef (thread) uses pthread_join to wait for the other threads to finish their tasks. It's like chefs waiting for each other to complete their dishes before serving the entire meal together.

			|							Thread vs Process					|
			|																|
			*****************************************************************

Processes are like separate kitchens with independent chefs, while threads are like collaborative teams sharing the same kitchen resources.

Single Chef (No Parallelism):
	Imagine a single chef (process) working in the kitchen.
	This chef handles all tasks independently, from chopping vegetables to grilling meat.


Hiring Additional Chefs (Processes):
-	To handle more tasks simultaneously, you decide to hire additional chefs (create multiple processes).
-	Each chef (process) works independently and has their own set of utensils and resources.
-	However, communication between chefs might require additional coordination.


Team of Chefs Collaborating (Threads):
-	Instead of hiring additional chefs (creating processes), you decide to hire kitchen assistants (create threads).
-	Each assistant (thread) collaborates with the main chef (main thread) and shares the same resources 
-	(kitchen utensils, cutting board).
-	Communication between the main chef and assistants is easier, but careful coordination is needed to avoid conflicts.
